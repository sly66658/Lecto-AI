# Lecto AI Promo Codes and Latest Lecto AI Affordable Translation API Deals for 2026

Looking at translation API services can feel a bit like shopping for phone plans—everyone's promising you the moon, but then you see the price tag and suddenly you're back to reality. But here's where Lecto AI steps in with something different. They're not trying to reinvent the wheel, just make it spin at a price that doesn't require a business loan.

## Lecto AI Introduction

Lecto AI runs a neural machine translation API that's built around one simple idea: translation shouldn't cost an arm and a leg. While the big players in cloud translation charge rates that make you wince every time you hit "translate," Lecto AI decided there had to be a better way.

The service supports over 90 languages and handles more than just plain text. Need to translate HTML without breaking your markup? They've got you. Working with JSON and want to protect certain values from translation? That works too. Multiple source texts and target languages in one request? Sure, why not.

What makes Lecto stand out is the pricing structure. At roughly $0.30 per million characters, they're significantly more affordable than most alternatives. They're not claiming to be magical—just practical, efficient, and honest about what they offer.

The API is powered by neural machine translation models, which is a fancy way of saying it uses modern AI techniques to produce quality translations. You get language detection that figures out what you're translating from, support for batch processing, and the ability to handle special formatting without making a mess of things.
